# Konstructor

CAD written in C++ and Qt

The purpose of this project is to create simple free and open source CAD with support for drawing part planes and extruding them to a 3D shape.

This software is linced under EUPL v1.2, other language versions are located in folder LICENCE, and are equally valid.

## current TODO list

# Plane

- rework constrains and dimensions

# Space

- implement face visibility (GL_CULL_FACE)
- extruding on created planes
- save and load Project files
- subtractive extrusion
